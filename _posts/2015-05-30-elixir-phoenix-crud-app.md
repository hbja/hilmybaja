Lately I've been looking at the
[Phoenix web framework](http://phoenixframework.org)
for the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) language.
Phoenix has taken
a lot of inspiration from Rails,
and the structure of a project
feels somewhat familiar
if you've worked with Rails.

To get familiar with the framework,
I'm starting with
a simple CRUD app
using Phoenix's scaffolding generator.
This post won't go into the code
in much detail,
and instead,
I'm trying to just get a basic app
running using Phoenix,
much like Rails' infamous
15-minute blog app.
Here, I'm using
Elixir 1.0.2,
Phoenix 0.13.1
and
Postgres 9.4.0
on OS X Mavericks.

**Installing Phoenix:**

If you haven't installed Elixir already,
you can do so by `brew install elixir`,
or the equivalent for your OS.
Now we need the
[hex package manager](https://hex.pm/)
to install Phoenix.
We can install hex by:

{% highlight bash %}
mix local.hex
{% endhighlight %}

Once hex is installed,
we can use it to install Phoenix
like this:

{% highlight bash %}
mix archive.install https://github.com/phoenixframework/archives/raw/master/phoenix_new.ez
{% endhighlight %}

It appears that future versions of Phoenix
will support installation via a
`mix archive.install phoenix` command.
This installs Phoenix
and also provide the `mix phoenix.new` command
to generate a new Phoenix project.

**Generating a new project:**

To generate the project,
we will use the `phoenix.new` mix task.
This sets up the project
and installs the dependencies.

{% highlight bash %}
$ mix phoenix.new blog
{% endhighlight %}

Phoenix uses [Brunch](http://brunch.io/)
to manage the front end assets,
and brunch is a node.js module.
So you will first need to make sure
that node installed on your machine.

**Running Phoenix server:**

Enter the `blog` directory
and run the `mix phoenix.server` command
to start running the app.
It will first compile
all the required modules
and then show the message:
"Running Blog.Endpoint with Cowboy on port 4000 (http)".

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd blog/
$ mix phoenix.server
{% endhighlight %}

If everything went smoothly,
you will see a "Welcome to Phoenix"
message at localhost:3000.

**Livereload FTW!**

One of the things that really impressed me
was that livereload is built into the framework.
To check this out,
edit the home page template,
`web/templates/page/index.html.eex`
and change "Welcome to Phoenix!" to
"Welcome to my blog!".

Now go back to the browser,
and voila, the text has already changed
without having to reload the page.

**Setting up the database**

Before we can start
adding our database tables,
we need to set up the database.
Open up `config/dev.exs`,
and edit the username and password
near the bottom of the file.
(They will both be set
to "postgres" by default.)

{% highlight elixir %}
# config/dev.exs
config :blog, Blog.Repo,
  adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres,
  username: "tyrion",
  password: "casterlyrock",
  database: "blog_dev",
  size: 10 # The amount of database connections in the pool
{% endhighlight %}

Next, let us create the database
using the `mix ecto.create` task.

{% highlight bash %}
$ mix ecto.create
Compiled ...
...
Generated blog.app
The database for Blog.Repo has been created.
{% endhighlight %}

Now our database is all set,
and we can proceed to
generating our scaffolded `Post` model.

**Creating our posts resource**

Phoenix gives us a `phoenix.gen.html` task
similar to Rails' `rails generate scaffold`.
Here we create a Post model,
with the database called posts
and two fields:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mix phoenix.gen.html Post posts title body:text
{% endhighlight %}

This generates a simple scaffold
to create, read, update and delete posts.
The command produces this output:

{% highlight text %}
* creating priv/repo/migrations/20150527180842_create_post.exs
* creating web/models/post.ex
* creating test/models/post_test.exs
* creating web/controllers/post_controller.ex
* creating web/templates/post/edit.html.eex
* creating web/templates/post/form.html.eex
* creating web/templates/post/index.html.eex
* creating web/templates/post/new.html.eex
* creating web/templates/post/show.html.eex
* creating web/views/post_view.ex
* creating test/controllers/post_controller_test.exs

Add the resource to the proper scope in web/router.ex:

    resources "/posts", PostController

and then update your repository by running migrations:

    $ mix ecto.migrate
{% endhighlight %}

This gives you a handy list of files
that you can explore to get an idea about
what Phoenix controllers, models and views look like.
(Note - the equivalent of Rails views
is called templates in Phoenix.
What we call views in Phoenix
are similar to presenters in Rails.)

Now let's follow the instructions
at the end of that output.
First, we'll add the routes
to the appropriate section of the router
at `web/router.ex`:

{% highlight elixir %}
defmodule Blog.Router do
  use Blog.Web, :router

  # other stuff

  scope "/", ElixirBlog do
    pipe_through :browser # Use the default browser stack
    get "/", PageController, :index

    resources "/posts", PostController
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

And now,
we can run the migrations
to create the posts table:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mix ecto.migrate
...
[info] == Running Blog.Repo.Migrations.CreatePost.change/0 forward
[info] create table posts
[info] == Migrated in 0.1s
{% endhighlight %}

At this point we will need to
restart the Phoenix server.
Going to `localhost:4000/posts`
will show you the generated scaffold for posts.
Click the "new post" link and add some posts.
The list of posts also shows options
to edit and delete these posts.

**Routing `/posts` as our homepage**

Now that we've added posts,
let's replace the default homepage
with the list of posts.
For this, we can edit `web/router.ex`:

{% highlight diff %}
- get "/", PageController, :index
+ get "/", PostController, :index
{% endhighlight %}

Now `localhost:4000/` shows the list of posts.

**Running tests**

When we generated the scaffold,
Phoenix also generated two test files
for `Post` model and `PostController`.
Taking a look at these generated tests
gives an idea about how we could go about
writing our own tests.

You can run the tests by `mix test`.
Before you can run the tests,
you might need to edit
the test database configuration
in `config/test.exs`
like we did for `config/dev.exs`.

**Final thoughts**

I loved how easy it was
to get started with Phoenix,
but CRUD apps aren't
Phoenix's biggest selling point.
I'm going to try out
the more interesting features of Phoenix,
like Channels,
which allows us to add
realtime features to our apps.
Next I want to try out
building a simple chat app using channels.
