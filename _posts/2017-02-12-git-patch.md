I was recently reviewing code on a project where I didn't have write access,
and wanted to suggest a small code change to the team.
As I couldn't send a pull request to make the change,
I had to look into how to create a patch that I could then email.

## Creating a patch

In this example, we will add a line to a Rails project's `Gemfile`.
When we add a `gem 'rspec-rails'` line, `git diff` looks like this:

{% highlight diff %}
diff --git a/Gemfile b/Gemfile
index c661619..989efe8 100644
--- a/Gemfile
+++ b/Gemfile
@@ -24,6 +24,7 @@ group :development do
   gem 'listen', '~> 3.0.5'
   gem 'spring'
   gem 'spring-watcher-listen', '~> 2.0.0'
+  gem 'rspec-rails'
 end

 gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]
{% endhighlight %}

We can save this as a patch file, without committing the code.

{% highlight bash %}
git diff > add-rspec.patch
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's look at what happens when you add a new file to the working directory.
Create a `notes.txt`, add a couple of lines there, and run `git diff`.
You will notice that the new file is not present in the diff.
To get it, you will need to stage all the files and then run `git diff --cached`.

{% highlight bash %}
git add .
git diff --cached > add-rspec.patch
{% endhighlight %}

Now the patch looks like:

{% highlight diff %}
diff --git a/Gemfile b/Gemfile
index c661619..989efe8 100644
--- a/Gemfile
+++ b/Gemfile

 gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]

+We are using rspec for testing.
+Rspec is the best.
{% endhighlight %}

## Binary patches

What if the new file we added was a binary file?
This time we will add a `logo.jpeg` file and stage it.
We can use the `--binary` option.

{% highlight bash %}
git add .
git diff --staged --binary > mypatch.patch
{% endhighlight %}

The patch file will look like this:

{% highlight diff %}
diff --git a/Gemfile b/Gemfile

## Creating patches from commits

Suppose you have created a new branch and made two commits -
one for adding rspec to Gemfile, and another for the notes file.
You can create a patch file for the commits by using `git format-patch`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git format-patch master
0001-Add-rspec-to-gemfile.patch
0002-Add-notes-file.patch
{% endhighlight %}

This will create a patch file for each commit.
Let's take a look at what one of the files looks like:

{% highlight diff %}
From 57c9101b014623049a6bb75ee43505058d494077 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001

 end

 gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]
--

{% endhighlight %}

If you don't want to create multiple patch files, you can do this:

{% highlight bash %}
git format-patch master --stdout > rspec-changes.patch
{% endhighlight %}

## Applying a patch

Now that we have looked at the different ways to create patches,
let's see how we can apply a patch file to the working directory.
Let's checkout a `review-rspec-patch` branch from master first.
Now let's apply one of the patch files we created earlier:

{% highlight bash %}
git apply 0001-Add-rspec-to-gemfile.patch
{% endhighlight %}

Using `git apply` provides the patch as unstaged changes in your branch.
If you want to apply the patches as commits, you can use `git am`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git am rspec-changes.patch
Applying: Add rspec to gemfile
Applying: Add notes file

$ git log --oneline
ac9caff Add notes file
f784b22 Add rspec to gemfile
8619310 ...older commits...
{% endhighlight %}
