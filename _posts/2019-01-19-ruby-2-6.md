Ruby 2.6 was released on Christmas day,
and brought a few interesting new features.
Here's a quick summary of what's changed.
As with my summaries of previous versions
([2.5](/posts/ruby-2-5-features/),
[2.4](/posts/ruby-2-4-features/),
[2.3](/posts/ruby-2-3-features/))
I'm only summarizing
features that I find most interesting.
For a complete list of changes,
take a look at the
[changelog](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/12/25/ruby-2-6-0-released/).

### Endless ranges

A new syntax was introduced to represent an endless range.
This will be useful when matching ranges in case statements.

```ruby
case n
when 1..9 then 'Single digit'
when 10..99 then 'Two digit'
when 100.. then 'Three or more'
end
```

Previously, `(1..)` would be represented as `(1..Float::INFINITY)`.
Not many people are familiar that you can
[represent infinity like this](/posts/ruby-infinity/),
so this syntax is a definite improvement.

### Composing procs, lambdas and methods

`#>>` and `#<<` methods were added to `Proc` and `Method` objects
to allow composing them into a new method.

```ruby
square = -> (n) { n * n }
add_2  = -> (n) { n + 2 }

(square >> add_2).call(5) #=> 27
(square << add_2).call(5) #=> 49
```

With the `#>>` operation,
the number gets `square`d first and then `add_2` is performed
on the result of the first proc call.
In case of `#<<`,
the order in which the procs are called is reversed.

I wish we didn't have
two different ways of composing procs,
and only had `#>>`.
But composition is an important addition to Ruby
that will allow us to write in a more functional style.

### `Kernel#then`

This isn't a new feature,
but an alias for `Kernel#yield_self`
which was introduced in Ruby 2.5,
and allows us to chain operations
into pipelines like this:

```ruby
isbn = '978-1-93778-549-9'

isbn.gsub('-', '')
  .then { |isbn| URI("#{API_URL}?q=isbn:#{isbn}") }
  .then { |uri| Net:HTTP.get(uri) }
  .then { |json_response| JSON.parse(json_response) }
  .then { |response| response.dig('items', 'volumeInfo') }
```

*(Shameless plug:
I recorded a guest episode on RubyTapas
showing a series of refactors leading to the code above -
[watch it here](https://www.rubytapas.com/2019/01/08/yield_self/).)*

### `Enumerable#chain` and `Enumerator#+`

This returns an `Enumerator::Chain` object,
which works as a single enumerator.

```ruby
(1..3).chain((5..7), [9, 10]).to_a
#=> [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]

list = (1..3).each + (5..7) + (9..10)
list.to_a
#=> [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
```

### Merge multiple hashes

`Hash#merge` only took one argument till 2.5.
The only way to merge more than two hashes
was to chain calls to `#merge`.
You can now pass multiple hashes to the method.

```ruby
foo = { a: 1 }
bar = { b: 2 }
baz = { c: 3 }

foo.merge(bar, baz) #=> { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

# ruby 2.5
# foo.merge(bar).merge(baz)
```

### `Array#union` and `Array#difference`

These methods work just like
the `|` and `&` operators.
The difference is that they can accept multiple arguments
and are easier to chain.

```ruby
a = [1, 1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 4]

a.union(b) #=> [1, 2, 3, 4]
a.difference(b) #=> [1, 1, 2]
```

### `Enumerable#to_h` with block

`Enumerable#to_h` now accepts a block that maps keys to values.
This allows us to transform hashes
without creating an intermediate array using `map`,
or using the harder-to-read `reduce` syntax.

```ruby
hash = { foo: 2, bar: 3 }
hash.to_h { |k, v| [k.upcase, v*v] } #=> { FOO: 4, BAR: 9 }

# ruby 2.5:
# hash.map { |k, v| [k.upcase, v*v] }.to_h
# hash.reduce({}) { |result, (k, v)| result.merge(k.upcase => v) }
```

### `Enumerator::ArithmeticSequence`

This subclass of `Enumerator`
was introduced to represent
objects created by calling `step`
on `Range` and `Numeric` objects.
This makes it possible to do things like
check equality of sequences.

```ruby
r1 = (1..10).step(2)
r2 = (1..10).step(2)

r1 == r2 #=> true if 2.6, false in 2.5
1.step == (1..).step #=> true
```

### Changes in `Range` behavior

**The `%` operator**
has been added as an alias to `step`.
So `(1..10) % 2` is equivalent to `(1..10).step(2)`.

**`Range#===` now uses uses `#cover?` instead of `#include?`.**
`case` statements internally use `===`,
so this could lead to subtly different behavior
in case statements.

`(a..b).cover?(x)` checks if `a <= x < b`,
whereas `(a..b).include?(x)`
iterates through the range
and checks if any element equals `x`.
This allows us to do things like:

```ruby
case DateTime.now
when Date.today..Date.today+1
  puts 'matched'
else
  puts 'not matched'
end
```

**Note**:
In a previous version of this article,
I used a string range in the example.
For backwards compatibility,
the behavior of string ranges hasn't changed.

```ruby
('a'..'c').cover?('bb')   #=> true
('a'..'c').include?('bb') #=> false

case 'bb'
when 'a'..'c' then 'matched'
else 'not matched'
end
#=> 'not matched'
```

### `exception` keyword argument for `Kernel` methods

An `exception` keyword argument
was added for some `Kernel` methods
like `Integer`, `Float` and `system`.
For the `Numeric` methods,
we can now pass `exception: false`
to avoid raising when parsing an invalid value,
and to instead return `nil`.

`Kernel#system`, on the other hand,
accepts `exception: true`
to raise
if the command exits with non-zero exit status
(instead of returning `false`)
or if command execution fails
(instead of returning `nil`).

```ruby
Integer('foo', exception: false) #=> nil
Float('foo', exception: false) #=> nil

system('foo', exception: true) #=> exception
```

### Performance improvements

The biggest news on the performance front
is that a JIT implementation,
called
[MJIT](https://medium.com/@k0kubun/the-method-jit-compiler-for-ruby-2-6-388ee0989c13),
was merged into Ruby.
This can be enabled
using the `--jit` flag.

MJIT has led to speedups in micro-benchmarks,
but isn't mature enough yet
to work for larger codebases like Rails apps.
It is even slower for Rails than the non-JIT version.

However, this is an important step
towards the Ruby 3x3 goal,
which is to make Ruby 3
at least 3x faster that Ruby 2.0.
Currently Ruby 2.6 with JIT is
[nearly 2.5x faster than 2.0](https://medium.com/@k0kubun/ruby-2-6-jit-progress-and-future-84e0a830ecbf)
on the Optcarrot benchmark,
which is used
to compare the performance
of Ruby releases
for the 3x3 goal.

Aside from this,
a second garbage collection heap,
called [Transient Heap](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14858),
was introduced,
which reduces memory usage
and improves GC speed
of short lived objects.
`Proc.call` and `block.call`

### Better introspection

Ruby's introspection abilities have been improved,
which the introduction
of the `RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree` class,
which lets us parse Ruby code into AST.
`Binding.source_location` was also added,
which returns an array containing
the file name and the line number
where it was called.

### Other changes

- [The flip flop operator](/posts/ruby-flip-flop/)
  is finally deprecated,
  and will probably be removed in Ruby 3.
- Bundler is now a default gem,
  so you no longer have to do `gem install bundler`
  after installing Ruby.
  Rubygems 3.0.1 was also merged into Ruby.
- `Array#filter` was added
  as an alias for `#select`.
- Previous versions of ruby warned
  if you had an `else` clause in a `begin` block
  without a `rescue`.
  This will cause a syntax error in 2.6.

```ruby
begin
  puts 'begin'
else
  puts 'else'
end

# Ruby 2.6
#=> foo.rb:5: else without rescue is useless

# Ruby 2.5
#=> foo.rb:7: warning: else without rescue is useless
#=> begin
#=> else
```
