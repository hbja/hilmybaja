Ruby 3.2 was released on Christmas day,
and I've been playing around with its new features.
The highlights this year are
the performance gains from YJIT,
WebAssembly support,
faster regular expressions,
and a new way to define immutable value objects,

_(This is only a list of things
I found most interesting about this release.
If you're looking for a more complete list,
take a look at the
[release announcement](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2022/12/25/ruby-3-2-0-released/).)_

### YJIT is now production ready (and really fast!)

YJIT, the new JIT compiler for Ruby,
was released last year
as an experimental feature.
Now it's been marked production ready,
and brings even more performance gains.
Here are a couple of reads
about real world performance gains:

- [Ufuk Kayserilioglu has written](https://twitter.com/paracycle/status/1605706226007941122)
  about deploying a prerelease version of Ruby 3.2 with YJIT
  to render Shopify storefronts,
  and seeing 10% speedups.
- [Peter Solnica has benchmarked](https://www.solnic.dev/p/benchmarking-ruby-32-with-yjit)
  the dry-rb libraries,
  and had some impressive numbers to share there.

YJIT was also
[completely rewritten in Rust](https://shopify.engineering/porting-yjit-ruby-compiler-to-rust)
in order to make it easier to maintain.
This allowed the team
to quickly add support for ARM.
This means that you can now run YJIT
on your M-series macs
or a Raspberry Pi.

### Immutable objects with `Data.define`

The newly introduced `Data` class
allows you to define
immutable value objects.

```ruby
# Create a Point data class
Point = Data.define(:x, :y)

# Instantiate a point object
p = Point.new(x: 3, y: 7)
```

This might seem familiar
because we already have `Struct.new`
which defines similar classes.
However, `Data` classes are immutable,
so don't have setters for the attributes.

```ruby
point.x = 42
#=> undefined method `x=' for #<data Point x=3, y=7> (NoMethodError)
```

`Data` also defines the `deconstruct` and `deconstruct_keys` methods
so that the objects can be pattern matched like this:

```ruby
case point
in Point(0, 0)
  puts "Origin"
in Point(x, y) if x + y > 10
  puts "Too far away"
in Point(x, y)
  puts "(#{x}, #{y})"
end
```

### `Struct` with keyword args

There's a small usability improvement with structs as well.
The `keyword_init: true` argument is no longer needed
to initialize structs with keyword args.

```ruby
# Ruby 3.1
Point = Struct.new(:x, :y, keyword_init: true)

# Ruby 3.2
Point = Struct.new(:x, :y)

Point.new(x: 2, y: 3)
#=> #<struct Point x=2, y=3>
```

### Regular expressions

There are improvements to `Regex`,
mainly to prevent ReDOS (regexp denial-of-service) attacks.
Firstly, the regexp matching algorithm has been improved
so that many matches will complete in linear time.
For regexes that can't use this optimization,
you can also set a timeout
so that a `Regexp::TimeoutError` is raised
if the match exceeds that time.

```ruby
# Set a 2s timeout for a single regex
pattern = Regexp.new(/foo/, timeout: 2)
"foo".match(pattern)

# Or set a global timeout
Regexp.timeout = 5
```

### IRB

One of my favorite things about recent releases of Ruby
is the focus on tools like IRB.
Ruby 3.2 bundles the latest version 1.6 of IRB.
This brings support for a lot of the debugging commands
that you might have seen in gems like `pry` and `byebug`.
Stan Lo, who worked on many of these features
has written in detail about
[the new features of IRB](https://st0012.dev/whats-new-in-ruby-3-2-irb).

As someone who has always used
`pry` and `pry-byebug`,
I'm excited about these changes.
We will be able to get most of the benefits
of those tools
out of the box with Ruby.


### Better error messages

`syntax_suggest` has been integrated into Ruby,
and points out missing or extra `end`s in your code.
This functionality was previously in a gem
called `dead_end`,
but it was merged into Ruby itself.

```
Unmatched `end', missing keyword (`do', `def`, `if`, etc.) ?
> 2  def foo
> 4  end
> 5  end
test.rb:5: syntax error, unexpected `end' (SyntaxError)
```

The builtin `error_highlight` gem
now highlights the relevant argument
for `TypeError` and `ArgumentError`.

```
test.rb:3:in `+': nil can't be coerced into Integer (TypeError)

bar = 1 + foo[5]
          ^^^^^^
        from test.rb:3:in `<main>'
```

### WebAssembly support

Ruby now supports WebAssembly,
which means that Ruby can now run in browsers!
You can already see this in action in the [Try Ruby playground](https://try.ruby-lang.org/playground/#code=3.times+do%0A++print+'Welcome+'%0Aend&engine=cruby-3.2.0).
Another example is
[Ruby Syntax Tree](https://ruby-syntax-tree.github.io/),
which converts Ruby code into s-expressions.
(Kevin Newton has written more about it
[here](https://kddnewton.com/2022/04/25/ruby-syntax-tree-github-io.html)).


### Other changes

- `Set` is now a builtin class,
  and you no longer need
  to `require "set"` to use it.
- `bundle gem` now supports `--ext=rust`
  to allow building gems with rust extensions.
  ([details here](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/6149))

### Further reading

With these posts,
I try to highlight some of the changes
that I found most interesting,
and often skip over features I might not use.
If you're looking for a more comprehensive look at the release,
I highly recommend looking at the
[release announcement](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2022/12/25/ruby-3-2-0-released/),
[changelog](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/ruby_3_2/NEWS.md),
and the excellent
[Ruby References website](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.2.html),
which covers all the new features in detail with lots of examples.
