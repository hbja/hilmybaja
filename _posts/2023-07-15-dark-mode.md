Ever since I migrated this site to Jekyll
over 10 years ago,
it's had a custom theme
with a light background.
For a while now,
I've wanted to update it
to use a dark background.
As someone who uses dark mode
on any website that provides it,
I found it annoying to proofread
my own blog posts on a light background.

I finally updated the site last week.
The layout hasn't changed drastically,
but I decided to create a post
with a few screenshots
so I can look back
at what this used to look like.
Hopefully, I'll write another one of these
when I get tired of this theme
in another 10 years time! ;)

## Home page

The home page is the only page
with significant changes
to the page layout:

- Added a bio at the top of the page
- Grouped posts by year so it's not a single long list of almost 100 posts
- Added a bit of spacing for the top navbar

## Mobile

This new posts list on the home page
didn't work so well on mobile,
so I decided to hide the date and categories
and instead show a simple `<ul>` list.

## Blog posts

The blog posts page has had the least changes to its layout.
The only change is the switch to light text on dark background.

I considered adding a way to switch
between dark and light themes,
but then decided not to.
I could instead be using that time
to write here more often!

Although I procrastinated for so long,
it was actually pretty quick to update the theme.
In fact, I did 90% of the work
when I was bored on a 2 hour train ride.
When I merged the branch,
it was a `+90, -77` [diff](https://github.com/nithinbekal/nithinbekal.github.io/pull/25).
