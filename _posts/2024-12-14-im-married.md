I'm retroactively posting this from the future, but I'm making a blogpost about my wedding!
It was quite a huge event! The final count of people was 798 :)

I've got to give a lot (almost all, basically) of credit to my mother-in-law, since she did all the planning and
legal affairs to make the day possible.

It was a great and happy day, where we had two events: the _akad_ and the wedding reception.
The _akad_ was nice and calm, since we only had close family and friends present.
I managed to not make any mistakes during the _ijab kabul_!
But I did make quite some silly mistakes during the _Sundanese_ ceremonial rites :)
I had to hold a lot of my tears coming down as my mother-and-sister-in-law walked the aisle with Zahra.
Felt quite a huge relief during that moment. Some feelings I just can't explain with words. 

The reception was when things got quite overwhelming: I basically only recognized 30% of the people present.
It was expected, since most of them were friends of parents.
In any case, I felt delighted how great we looked in our wedding attire.
Here's a discreet picture, since I don't want our wedding pictures public:

Stunning.
I also think I don't look too bad myself.
Was such a nice moment.

Also had a moment where I played a song with the guitar and Zahra sang.
It was [Close to you by the Carpenters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFx-5PGLgb4).
I was quite nervous and made some mistakes, but Zahra's voice was super nice and covered a lot of my guitar mistakes.
It was a great and tiring day.
After the whole thing, we had to quickly pack to fly back to the Netherlands the coming day.

As I reminisce, it's quite an achievement getting married in the middle of doing a PhD.
