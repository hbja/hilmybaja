When my 5 year old Galaxy Watch Active2 finally gave out this year,
I decided to wait a couple of months
for Samsung's announcement of the 7 series watches.
The wait paid off
with both Watch 7 and Ultra
being great updates to the lineup.
The Galaxy series still remains
the best option if you're in the Android ecosystem.

In the end,
I picked up the Ultra model.
The larger screen, durability and battery capacity
swayed me in its favor.
But truth be told,
the Watch 7 is the stronger contender,
with most of the same features
at less than half the price.

## Display

The 47mm screen size
does feel a tad large on my wrist,
and the watch is also quite thick,
which makes it feel bulkier.
It's a bit less comfortable than the Watch Active2,
but it didn't take too long to get used to it.
However, the large screen size has meant that
I have on occasion used the watch
to type out a reply to a text.

## Battery

If I had to pick one feature
that pushed me to the Ultra over the regular Watch 7,
it was the much larger battery.
It has a 590mAh battery,
compared to 425mAh on the 44mm Watch 7,
and 300mAh on the 40mm model.

As I'm writing this,
the watch has been running for 3 days and an hour,
with 7% remaining.
This is without always on display (AOD),
but still impressive.
I tried the AOD
and it lasted a few hours less.

When I first got the watch,
battery life was closer to 2 days without AOD.
That's decent,
but the Watch Active2 was already lasting a day and a half.
However, a recent software update
made a drastic improvement
and pushed it over the 3 day mark.
For comparison,
the Apple Watch Ultra lasts about 36 hours,
and the basic Apple watch about 18 hours.

#### Charging

Previous Galaxy watches supported revere charging,
where you could prop up the watch
on the back of your Samsung phone,
to charge it.
Unfortunately,
**this watch doesn't support reverse charging,**
which is baffling to me.
This was a perfect example
of Samsung's watches and phones being perfectly integrated
like you'd see in the Apple ecosystem,
but they made them incompatible.

The charging puck also comes with a USB-C connector,
so I usually have to connect it to my Macbook to charge
because I don't have anything else to connect it to.

## Design

The "squircle" shape of the watch has divided opinion.
The screen is still circular,
but the frame has a squarish shape,
probably in an attempt to make it
look more like the Apple Watch Ultra.
I don't hate it,
and have gotten used to it,
but it's not a shape I would choose.

There are no physical rotating bezels.
Those have long been highlight of flagship Galaxy watches.
They allow using the watch without touchscreen with gloves on.
This would have been really useful
during the cold Canadian winters,
but unfortunately that's missing here.

The choice to put a third button on the side is interesting.
I haven't found them especially useful,
but it's nice to be able to map actions to them.

## Software

Galaxy Watch has moved from Samsung's Tizen OS
to Google's Wear OS since the Watch 4.
This brings with it
wider support for apps,
and a tighter integration with Android.

I've found apps to work better on this watch
than on the Tizen based Watch Active2.
For instance,
the Strava app was often flaky with GPS signals,
but the few times I used it with this watch,
it's worked flawlessly.
Even Samsung's own camera app,
which lets you remotely control the phone camera,
used to crash or frequently fail to connect on the Active2,
but has worked perfectly well here.

## Health features

The watch comes with a handful of health features,
but the two I pay attention to are
sleep score and the energy score.
Already, I'm seeing my sleep habits improving
as I keep an eye on the scores
and notice what's hindering my sleep quality.
The energy score is based on a few factors for the previous day
including sleep quality, physical activity, etc.
I've found it to reasonably reflect
how I'm feeling on most days.

There's also the AGEs index,
which is supposed to show your metabolic age.
For me, it constantly hovers in the middle,
and feels gimmicky.
The stress score is also not very useful.
I've found it showing low stress levels
on pretty stressful days.

## Gestures

If you're so inclined,
you can set up the watch to respond to gestures,
like shaking your wrist to dismiss,
or mapping knock-knock and pinch gestures
to specific actions.
I didn't find the gesture control
to be intuitive enough to be useful.

Far too often,
it would have false positives,
where a timer would get dismissed
because it incorrectly detected
a shake-to-dismiss gesture.
After the 100th time this happened,
I disabled the feature completely.

## NFC and payments

The Tizen versions of Galaxy watches
only supported Samsung Pay,
which isn't widely accepted,
so I was never able to use it.
With the move to Wear OS
and better integration with Android and Google services,
I'm able to use Google Wallet with the watch now.
Again, super useful in the winter months
when the phone might be buried
inside an inner jacket pocket.

One annoying thing I have encountered
is when I bring my phone close to the watch,
it accidentally scans it as an NFC tag.
This happens because the watch thinks
the phone is some exercise equipment
and tries pairing with it.
Disabling Samsung Health in the NFC connections settings
prevents this from happening.

## Watch 7 vs Watch Ultra

The Galaxy Watch 7 and the Ultra
have essentially the same features,
so the Watch 7 is much better value
at almost half the price.
The only big differences that mattered to me
were the battery capacity, screen size and durability.

The Watch Ultra,
with its 590mAh battery,
can last much longer than
the Watch 7's 425mAh.
That should last at least an extra day.
This comes at the expense of size.
The Ultra is much heavier (60.5g vs 33.8),
but that affords it a larger screen size
(47mm compared to 40 or 44mm versions).

There's also the ruggedness
that the Ultra's titanium body provides.
Aside from that,
it can withstand more extreme conditions
than the non-Ultra version.
The ability to withstand -20C
is nice for Canadian winters,
but I don't see myself needing to track
10ATM underwater or at 9000m altitude,
so that's mostly for the dedicated fitness enthusiasts.

## Final thoughts

If you're looking for a smartwatch today,
the Apple Watch is an easy pick if you're on IOS,
but on the Android side,
there are more options.
However, the Galaxy watches
seem to be a long ahead right now.

After 3 months of use,
would I recommend the Watch Ultra?
Probably not.
It's a great watch,
but the much cheaper Watch 7
has most of the features
and the Ultra is overkill for most people.

That said,
I don't regret getting it.
The longer battery life was a big selling point for me,
and recent software updates have pushed that even further.
And with this build quality,
it will hopefully last for years.
