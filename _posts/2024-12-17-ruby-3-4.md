A new version of Ruby is released every year on Christmas day.
The 3.4 release will be out next week,
so I've been playing around with the release candidate.
Here are some of the features I found interesting.

_(As an aside,
I just realized that
this is the 10th year in a row
that I've written one of these
"what's new in Ruby" recaps!)_ 🎉

## 🧱 `it` - the default block parameter

Ruby introduced numbered block parameters
5 years ago in version 2.7.
This allowed us to use `_1`, `_2` etc
instead of explicit block parameters.
Now, a new variable called `it` has been added
to refer to the default block parameter.
This can be handy when chaining multiple operations:

```ruby
isbn.gsub("-", "")
  .then { URI.parse("#{endpoint}?q=isbn:#{it}") }
  .then { Net::HTTP.get(it) }
  .then { JSON.parse(it) }
  .then { extract_volume_info(it) }

def extract_volume_info(response)
  return if response["totalItems"] == 0
  response["items"]["volumeInfo"]
end
```

I like this as a shorthand for local method calls.
Previously, if you wanted shorthand syntax
for a method in local scope,
you'd write something like `&method(:foo)`.

```ruby
# old
list.map(&method(:transform))

# new
list.map { transform(it) }
```

With the `&method` syntax,
the method name is a symbol,
making it harder for editors and IDEs
to identify it as a method reference
when using the "find references" feature.
With the new syntax,
it's easier for tools to identify it as a method call.
The above code also allocates an unnecessary block object,
which is avoided in the `it` version.

## 🥶 Chilled strings

Ruby 2.3 introduced the concept of frozen string literals,
with the `frozen_string_literal: true` comment,
which would make any string literal immutable by default.
However, it hasn't been possible
to make this the default behavior
due to compatibility concerns with many libraries.

Ruby 3.4 takes another step towards immutable strings
by introducing the concept of chilled strings.
Now files without the `frozen_string_literal` comment
will treat string literals as "chilled",
which means they can still be mutated,
but it will emit a warning on mutation.

You can use the `-W:deprecated` flag
to see which strings are being mutated.
If you see a string being mutated,
make sure to explicitly mark it as mutable
by either calling `String.new`
or using the unary `+` operator.

Let's take an example:

```ruby
s = "foo"
s << "bar"
# foo.rb:2: warning: literal string will be frozen in the future 
# (run with --debug-frozen-string-literal for more information)
```

Now if we run with `--debug-frozen-string-literal`:

```bash
ruby -W:deprecated --debug-frozen-string-literal foo.rb

# foo.rb:2: warning: literal string will be frozen in the future
# foo.rb:1: info: the string was created here
```

To fix this, you can use
either `s = String.new("foo")`
or use the unary `+` operator
(`s = +"foo"`).

```ruby
# Works fine
s = String.new("foo")
s << "bar" # no warning

# Also works fine
s = +"foo"
s << "bar" # no warning
```

## 🌈  Prism is the new default parser

Ruby 3.3 introduced a new parser for Ruby called [Prism](https://github.com/ruby/prism).
It is designed to be
more error tolerant, and easier to maintain.
With 3.4, it will ship as the default parser for Ruby,
replacing the `lrama` parser generator,
which generates the parser
from the 16kLOC long
[`parse.y`](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/9715131c32fa9753da6a616c9ad3891e27bcff5b/parse.y) file,
that is hard to maintain.

Prism is already the default
for many other Ruby implementations
(JRuby, TruffleRuby, Natalie, Opal)
and community tools (Rubocop, RBI, Ruby LSP etc).
Having it become the single source of language grammar
makes it easier for tooling to keep up
with changes in Ruby.

## 🗑️ Modular GC

Ruby's garbage collection
has been made more modular,
so alternative garbage collectors
can be dynamically loaded at runtime.
As part of this,
an experimental GC based on [MMTk](https://www.mmtk.io/)
has been merged into Ruby.

This will allow more experimentation
with modern high performance GCs,
and make it easier
to compare different GC implementations in production.

## 🚀 More YJIT improvements

Ever since YJIT became Ruby's default JIT compiler in Ruby 3.1,
we have seen incredible performance jumps every year.
This year is no different.
On [YJIT benchmarks](https://speed.yjit.org/),
YJIT is a whopping 92% faster
compared to runnning Ruby without JIT.

Railsbench shows 95% speedup,
but real world apps
are usually more constrained
by IO than benchmarks.
However, many real world Rails apps
have shown 15-20% speedups with YJIT in Ruby 3.3,
so expect speedups in a similar ballpark.
(Rails also enables YJIT by default now.)

An interesting development with YJIT
is that more of the core library methods
(such as [`Array#each`](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20182))
can now be rewritten in Ruby instead of C
and can take advantage of YJIT's optimizations.
Aaron Patterson's excellent article,
[Ruby Outperforms C](https://railsatscale.com/2023-08-29-ruby-outperforms-c/),
goes in depth into why this makes things faster.

## 🙈 Monkeypatch warnings

Ruby's flexibility means that
you can even monkeypatch core classes
if you wanted to.
However, many of these methods
have special handling in the interpreter and JIT,
and redefining them can negatively affect performance.
With 3.4, redefining such methods
will cause a performance warning.
The feature request has a list
of the methods that shouldn't be redefined:

- [Feature #20429: Emit a performance warning when specially optimized core methods are redefined](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20429)

## 💎 Ruby toplevel module is reserved

The `Ruby` namespace is now reserved,
which means that if you define a class or module called `Ruby`,
you will see a warning.
With 3.5.0, a new `Ruby` module will be introduced,
but for now there's nothing in that namespace.
I expect we'll eventually see things like `Ruby::VERSION`
exposed through the module
instead of top level constants like `RUBY_VERSION`.
