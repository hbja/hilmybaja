Hi everyone. This is my first blogpost here. I'm still very much learning the
ropes with Jekyll and all the HTML and CSS abstractions. I am a modeller at
heart: comfortable with object-oriented or functional programming.
But learning these new things always excite me.

It took me 30 minutes to set the Jekyll site up locally, including the time to
write the CSS from scratch. (Admittedly, there isn't much CSS here, but still.)
Linking it with my own domain with Github pages was easy enough.

*Will* post more things in the future, so stay tuned!
