In this blog, I posted some time ago in the news section that I was going to speak in WUR's Dies Natalis.
Well, that day has passed and it was quite an experience!

It was my first time speaking in front of such an audience. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the process.
Although, quite a lot of (sporadic) practice sessions had to be done beforehand.
Zahra can give a testimony of how much I randomly repeat sentences of my speech at home :)
It was quite tiring as well since we just arrived from the US the night before, after attending the AAAI
conference in Philadelphia.

Up in the stage, all I could see were the professors sitting on the front row, because the backside of the room 
was quite dark.
I was surprisingly not nervous. I have proof [here](https://youtu.be/DMepAa0BWOc?si=taKipNlbT_RQGMKr)
(it's the video of my speech if it's not obvious :)).
When I sat down in the chair after my turn, my stomach started to churn. I'm glad my body just remembered to be
nervous right _after_ the presentation. Oh, did I mention I was _fasting_ for Ramadan during this whole thing?
Definitely a unique experience.
Nonetheless, I got some nice (professional) photos from the speech!
