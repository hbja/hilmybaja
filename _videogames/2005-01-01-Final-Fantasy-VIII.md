Final Fantasy VIII.

This is my first ever final fantasy.
This is also my all-time-favorite entry in the series.
I'm not sure if it's just [nostalgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awwSFJdWrRQ), or
is there any concrete reason I love this game.

I'll try and get into my thoughts about the game in this blogpost, I'll let my mind run through and
my fingers type words, and we'll see if I have any reason to put this game as one of my favorite games
of all time.
