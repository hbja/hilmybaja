Final Fantasy VIII.

This is my first ever final fantasy.
This is also my all-time-favorite entry in the series.
I'm not sure if it's just [nostalgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awwSFJdWrRQ), or
is there any concrete reason I love this game.

I'll try and get into my thoughts about the game in this blogpost, I'll let my mind run through and
my fingers type words, and we'll see if I have any reason to put this game as one of my favorite games
of all time.

FF8 was a fascinating game back then --- even until now.
I knew nothing about the game; having borrowed the scratched up PS1 CD from my neighbors to emulate with my shitty PC, even they didn't know what the game was about.
When I got everything to work, the intro FMV was phenomenal; Liberi Fatali starting with the sound of the sea, no expectation and not understanding anything in the FMV.
While I'm on the topic: the soundtrack.
Every soundtrack from the FF8 always brings me back to moments in the game.
FF8 --- in my opinion --- has the best soundtrack in the Final Fantasy verse.
Listing my favorites would be just like listing the tracks in the album.
But my top mentions are Balamb Garden, Breezy, Fisherman's Horizon, Force Your Way, The Man with the Machine Gun, and Liberi Fatali. 
Until today, the tracks remain a constant tune that accompanies me during my working coding sessions.

The gameplay...
It was quite a tough cookie to figure out back then, especially the [Junction system](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Junction_system).
Didn't help that I was 9 years old when I was trying to figure things out.
It was rumored that the Junction system was tough even for adults to understand.
The tutorial that the game offered was not helpful at all, so I ended up pushing through the game without understanding things.
Despite that, I had SO much fun
