This was a Final Fantasy entry that surprised me, one way or another.
I did initially expect something different, from the glimpses of reviews I got around the internet.
But what I got was something far different.

The combat was very action heavy, rather than the usual more tactical turn-based style that is common in FFs.
This wasn't too strange as we've seen Square Enix moving away from a more tactical setting in its latest FF installments
(FFXV and FFVII: Remake). What surprised me was that we could only control one character: Clive.
Sure, close to the end we learn why Clive was special, but it felt the combat system strayed a bit too far from the party management we normally
get with FF games. Even the latest action-leaning FF entries still let us control multiple characters one-by-one.

One large critique I have is that progression felt "fake" in this game. Since we were controlling Clive, we could only change
his equipment. We can improve his equipment through the blacksmith with every progression of the story. But this overall
felt fake since enemies also get stronger and we will receive these newer equipment anyways. So, the linear progression
doesn't feel like it was due to how we were playing, but more like the game was holding our hand and whatever we did or
however our style of playing, it didn't matter much, since we would stay the same "strength" throughout the game.

One thing I have to give kudos though are the cinematic fights between Eikons. I mean, look at [this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTqivcrxNF4)
It has been a long time since I was amazed by the cinematic effects in a video game. Watching this on my TV in the dark
felt like I was watching a blockbuster movie.

The story was good. I really like the direction of the story, since they focus on a political and religious state of
 the world. A large portion was on Clive and his emotional and "spiritual" journey discovering who he was and how he could
help Valisthea's social structure, allowing people to live and die by their own terms.
 Although, I felt the story somehow fell a bit flat at the end. Maybe due to
the antagonists dying one-by-one throughout the story, leaving a big gap of where the cast was with only the big baddie at
the end. Was not my favorite FF story, or even FF game in general for sure, but it is one that was quite memorable.
