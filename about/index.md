#### Hi, I'm Nithin!

I'm a programmer living in Ottawa, Canada,
and I work at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/).

Before joining Shopify, I co-founded
[WowMakers](http://www.wowmakers.com/) and
[CrowdStudio.in](https://www.crowdstudio.in/)
in Kochi, India.
There I was part of the Rubyconf India team in 2016 and 2017,
and also used to help organize the Kochi Ruby meetups &mdash;
and the Chennai.rb meetups when I lived in Chennai.
