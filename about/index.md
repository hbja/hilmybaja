#### Hi there! I'm Hilmy

I'm a PhD candidate in Wageningen University, currently living in Wageningen, the Netherlands.
I am doing my PhD as a part of the [Smart Droplets](https://smartdroplets.eu) project.

My background is in Electrical Engineering. Though, after I graduated my double-degree bachelor's
in Germany, I generally felt less inclined to go down the path of being a strictly technical
engineer. During some downtime after graduation I visited my grandpa who was living in this very remote
island in Indonesia. He still manages it in a very traditional way. I often hear his stories about
not getting a lot of yield every year due to many factors. This of course affected his general livelyhood.
I then thought to myself that I could use my engineering knowledge to help people like him.

After receiving a full-ride scholarship, I then enrolled in Biosystems Engineering, a master's program exactly at
the junction between Agriculture and Technology. For the rest of my professional journey, I still
envision to contribute more in this field through research. But considering the state of the world, I have to
be realistic with any opportunities that come to my way.

Now on to more light-hearted stuff :)

I am a self-proclaimed coffee geek, even though I don't drink as much coffee as other people. But
I do have a lot of coffee gear at home, of which I spend a lot of time every morning to do my coffee 
making ritual.

In my free time I either play video games, jam on the guitar, cook random things or hangout with my lovely wife.
I almost exclusively play single-player story-driven video games, as it doesn't require
me to be glued to the screen and keyboard for 3 hours straight and I can stop or pause whenever I want to.
You can find thoughts on the stories of the latest and past video games I am playing and have played [here.](/videogames)

If you want to initiate some research collaborations in the field of AI, I am happy to do so!
